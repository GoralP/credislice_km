          </p>
          <p>
            In most cases, we collect Personal Data directly from you. We will
            ask you for Personal Data when you interact with us, such as
            registering on our websites, using any interactive features or
            applications, signing up to receive a newsletter or a rebate,
            participating in a savings program, making a direct purchase, or
            applying for employment. We may collect additional data from third
            party data suppliers who enhance our files or from social media
            sites such as LinkedIn or Facebook, if you like our pages or join
            our communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you interact with us online, we use cookies and other
            technological tools to collect data about your computer and your use
            of our website and applications. If you use a mobile application

            the data that the mobile application collects and what information
            it may transfer to the Company. We treat this data as Personal Data,
            only when it, or other data that is associated with it, can be used
            to identify you. For more information about cookies and other
            technologies, please see the “Cookies and Other Data Collection

              4. When and Why Personal Data Is Disclosed by CrediSlice
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Company will share Personal Data only in compliance with
            applicable laws and regulations. For example, we may share Personal
            Data as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li className="pt-2">
              We may share Personal Data with your consent or as you direct.
            </li>
            <li className="pt-2">
              We may share Personal Data with our affiliated companies and
              product co-promotion partners, which may only use Personal Data
              for the purposes listed herein.
            </li>
            <li className="pt-2">
              We may share Personal Data with our service providers, who are
              bound by law or contract to protect Personal Data and only use
              Personal Data in accordance with our instructions or the
              agreements we have signed. For example, we may share Personal Data
              with vendors who provide data processing or fulfilment services
              for us.
            </li>
            <li className="pt-2">
              We may also disclose Personal Data where needed to affect the sale
              or transfer of business assets, to investigate legal issues,
              enforce our rights, protect our property, or protect the rights,
              property or safety of others, or as needed support external
              auditing, compliance and corporate governance functions.
            </li>
            <li className="pt-2">
              We may share Personal data with credit reporting agencies.
            </li>
            <li className="pt-2">
              We may also disclose Personal Data when requested under legal
              process or otherwise required by law, such as in response to a
              subpoena, including to law enforcement agencies and courts in the
              United States and other countries where we operate.
            </li>
            <li className="pt-2">
              Please note that we may also disclose data about you that is not
              personally identifiable. For example, we may publish reports that
              contain aggregate and statistical data about our customers. These
              reports do not contain any data that would enable the recipient to
              contact, locate, or identify you.

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>5. Cookies and Other Data Collection Technologies</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            When you visit our websites or use our mobile applications, we
            collect many different types of data by automated means, using
            technologies such as APIs, web services, scripts, cookies, pixels,
            tags, web beacons, browser analysis tools, and server logs.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may collect data about the device you use to access our websites
            or services associated with our mobile apps, your operating system
            type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as
            the language your system uses and the country, region and time zone
            where your device is located. Our server logs also record the IP
            address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. An IP
            address is a unique identifier that devices use to identify and
            communicate with each other on the Internet. We may also collect
            data about the website you were visiting before you came to our
            website, and the website you visit after you leave our website. We
            may also use vendors, such as Adobe and Google, to place cookies and
            collect data to enable certain services we use, including
            advertising, visitor tracking, personalization, site analytics and
            security services, including reCAPTCHA, and the data may be
            disclosed to our vendors for these purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other data may be disclosed to vendors providing additional services
            integrated into the Company’s websites, underwriting systems, and
            mobile apps, including performance monitoring, user experience
            components such as user interface frameworks, images and web fonts,
            maps, and ecommerce functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            In many cases, the data we collect using cookies and other tools is
            only used in a non-identifiable way, without any reference to
            Personal Data. However, under some privacy and data protection laws,
            this data could be considered Personal Data. This Privacy Statement
            governs how we use this data when it is considered your Personal
            Data. For example, we use the data we collect about all website
            users, including IP address to optimize our websites and to
            understand website traffic patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you visit our websites, we may place cookies on your computer.
            Cookies are small text files that websites send to your computer or
            other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or
            to store data or settings in your browser. Cookies allow us to
            recognize you when you return. They also help us provide a
            customized experience and enable us to detect certain kinds of
            fraud. Some of our websites may use Web Storage instead of cookies.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have separated the cookies that we use on our websites and mobile
            apps into the following general categories: Functional Cookies,
            Analytics Cookies, Advertising Cookies, and Social Media Cookies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Functional Cookies: Functional Cookies are automatically placed on
            your browser and may involve disclosure of data to our service
            providers. The Company’s websites use functional cookies, including
            Session Cookies, to support the functionality of our websites, such
            as storing user preferences or maintaining a temporary store of
            values entered into forms. Session cookies generally expire after a
            short period of time, while other functional cookies can be cleared
            by using your browser’s “Forget This Site” functionality or by
            clearing your browser’s history.
          </p>
          <p>
            Analytics Cookies: Analytics Cookies are automatically placed on
            your browser. The Company’s websites and mobile apps collect
            analytics data to allow us to personalize and enhance your online
            experience, by analyzing repeat visits, user journeys through our
            websites, and user interaction with website elements. The Company’s
            websites use first-party cookies for these purposes, while our
            website analytics vendors, including Adobe and Google, may also
            place cookies in your browser to provide us with analytics services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Certain Company websites use Adobe Flash Cookies (also known as
            Local Shared Objects), Microsoft Silverlight, and similar
            technologies. Adobe Flash Player is an application that allows rapid
            development of dynamic content, such as video clips and animation.
            Flash Cookies (and similar applications) use technology to remember
            settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies, but
            these are managed through a different interface than the one
            provided by your web browser. For more information about how to
            manage Flash Cookies and/or Silverlight Cookies, you should refer to
            those vendors’ privacy and data sharing statements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pixels and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website
            pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have
            performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or
            click an email, the pixels or web beacons generate a notice to us of
            that action. These tools allow us to measure response to our
            communications and improve our web pages and promotions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Third Party Advertising Cookies. We may use third party advertising
            companies to place our ads on other websites. One way we do so is by
            allowing network advertising companies and social media (“Network
            Advertisers”) with whom we work to place their own cookies on the
            browser of an individual who visits one or more of our sites and who
            clicks “accept” on the cookie consent banner on the site. This
            enables these Network Advertisers to place a cookie on your computer
            and to receive information (including for example your IP Address,
            internet tracking data, and advertising IDs) from that cookie that
            may include information about your visits to this and other
            websites. This data received by Network Advertisers allows them to
            measure advertising effectiveness and to provide advertisements on
            other websites about our goods and services that are tailored to you
            and that may be of interest to you on these other websites. These
            Network Advertisers may in turn disclose your cookie data to other
            network advertisers to allow these advertisers to display ads to you
            as well. Under CCPA these additional disclosures may be considered a
            sale of personal information.
          </p>
          <p>
            To revoke your consent or opt-out after you have consented to the
            cookie consent banner, or to manage your cookie preferences, you can
            delete the cookies on your browser or use the cookie settings on
            your browser. All browsers are different, so visit the “Help”
            section, or the equivalent, of your browser to learn how to delete
            the cookies we set in your browser, including the cookie consent,
            and about cookie preferences and other privacy settings that may be
            available.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>6. Social Media Cookies</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Company’s websites may use social medial plugins (e.g., the
            Facebook “Like” button, “Share to Twitter” button) to enable you to
            easily share information with others. When you visit our website and
            click “Accept” on the cookie consent banner, the operators of the
            social plugins and integrated social media platforms can place
            cookies on your computer, enabling those operators to receive
            information (including for example your IP address, internet
            tracking data, and advertising IDs) from those cookies on your
            computer that allow those operators to see that you have previously
            visited our site. If you are logged into a social media website
            (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) while browsing on our website, the social
            media plugins allow those social media websites to share data about
            your activities on our website with other users of their social
            media website. For example, Facebook Social Plugins allows Facebook
            to show your Likes and comments on our pages to your Facebook
            friends. Facebook Social Plugins also allows you to see your
            friends’ Facebook activity on our website. The Company does not
            control any of the content from the social media plugins. For more
            information about social plugins from other social media websites
            you should refer to those sites’ privacy and data sharing
            statements.

            <strong>Part III. Other Important Information</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>7. Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to websites
            with which the browser communicates. Websites linked to this Privacy
            Policy do not currently respond to these “do-not-track” signals.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>8. Your Choices</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            You can always limit the data you provide to the Company, but if you
            choose not to provide certain requested information, you may be
            unable to access some of the services, offers, and content on our
            websites. You can also limit the communications that the Company may
            send to you by following a simple opt-out process. Simply follow the
            instructions in our advertisement/promotional emails to opt-out of
            receiving future marketing communications
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that even if you opt-out of promotional emails, we may
            still need to contact you with important transactional data about
            your account or your purchase. For example, even if you opt-out of
            advertisement/promotional emails, we will still send you a
            confirmation when you purchase something from our website, a
            notification of changes to, expiration of, or discontinuation of a

            <strong>9. Data Security</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Company has implemented a data security program that contains
            administrative, technical and physical controls that are designed to
            reasonably safeguard your Personal Data from unlawful use and
            unauthorized disclosure. The security of information transmitted
            through the internet cannot, however, be guaranteed. We are not
            responsible for any interception or interruption of any
            communications or for changes to or losses of data through the
            internet. You are responsible for maintaining the security of any
            password, user ID or other form of authentication involved in
            obtaining access to password protected or secure areas of websites,
            applications, or other services. Any access to websites,
            applications, or other services through your user ID and password
            will be treated as authorized by you. To help protect your Personal
            Data, we may suspend your use of all or part of the websites,
            applications, or services, without notice, if we suspect or detect
            any security issues.

            <strong>10. Disclosure to Subsequent Owner or Operator</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            If all or part of the Company is sold or merged into another entity,
            the data we have about you may be transferred to a third party as
            part of that transaction. We will try to assure that no Personal
            Data that is transferred will be used or shared in a manner
            inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. However, in the event of a
            sale or merger, your continued use of this site signifies your
            agreement to be bound by the privacy statement or policy and other
            applicable terms of the subsequent owner or operator.

              11. Consent to Processing in the United States and Elsewhere
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            This site is owned and operated by the Company in the United States,
            but the data you provide will be accessible to our affiliates,
            vendors, and suppliers in other countries. Furthermore, if you are
            visiting this site from another country, other than the United
            States, your communication with us will necessarily result in the
            transfer of data across international boundaries. The level of legal
            protection for Personal Data is not the same in all countries.
            However, we will take the security measures described in this
            Privacy Policy in an effort to keep your data secure. By using this
            site, you consent to the collection, storage, and processing of your
            data in the United States and in any country to which we may
            transfer your data in the course of our business operations.

            <strong>12. Privacy Statements of Third Parties</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of data by
            the Company. We may provide links to outside websites or
            advertisements for third parties that have their own privacy
            statements and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Our
            independent dealers, suppliers and business partners have their own
            privacy statements too. We encourage you to familiarize yourself
            with the privacy statements provided by all third parties prior to
            providing them with data or taking advantage of an offer or
            promotion.

          <p>
            <strong>13. Children’s Privacy</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Company’s websites and applications are not intended to attract
            children, and we do not knowingly collect any Personal Data from
            anyone under the age of 13. If you believe your child is using our
            website, please contact us so we can investigate and delete any data
            as may be appropriate.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>14. Forums, Product Reviews and Other Public Areas</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Our websites may contain forums and other areas where you can
            publicly post product reviews, communicate with others, and submit
            media content. Prior to posting in these areas, please read our
            Terms of Use carefully. You have no privacy rights in public
            postings. All the data you post will be accessible to anyone with
            Internet access, and any Personal Data you include in your posting
            may be read, collected, and used by others. For example, if you post
            your email address along with a product review, you may receive
            unsolicited messages. Please use caution when posting any Personal
            Data.
          </p>

          <p>
            By submitting data to us online, you are sending it to the United
            States, where it will be subject to the protections afforded under
            US laws that may be different from the laws in your country and
            which your country may consider not to provide adequate privacy
            protections. If you do not agree that your submission of your
            application data will be governed solely by United States law, the
            Company will not accept your application.

            <strong>15. Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We will only use Personal Data in the manner described in this
            Privacy Policy in effect when the data was collected from you.
            However, we reserve the right to change the terms of this Privacy
            Policy at any time by posting revisions to our site. If we make any
            material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will either notify you
            or place a prominent notice on our website. If at any point, we
            decided to use Personal Data in a manner that is materially
            different from that stated at the time it was collected, you will be
            given a choice to allow or disallow any additional material uses or
            disclosures of your personally identifiable data, beyond that which
            was stated in this Privacy Policy at the time your data was
            collected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any portions of this Privacy Policy are void to the extent they are
            prohibited by applicable law.

          </p>
          <p>
            The Company collects Social Security numbers in the ordinary course
            of its business. The Company has implemented reasonable technical,
            physical and administrative safeguards to help protect the Social
            Security numbers from unlawful use and unauthorized disclosure. All
            Company workers are required to follow these established procedures,

            numbers is limited to those workers and service providers who have a
            need to access the data to perform tasks for the Company. Social
            Security numbers are only disclosed to third parties in accordance
            with the Company’s established Privacy Policy.
          </p>

            We will only disclose Social Security numbers: (i) with those
            service providers, auditors, advisors, and/or successors in interest
            who are legally or contractually obligated to protect them, or (ii)
            as required or permitted by law.
